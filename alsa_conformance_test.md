# Alsa Conformance Test

<!--* freshness: { owner: 'yuhsuan' reviewed: '2019-08-19' } *-->

ALSA Conformance Test is a tool to verify the correctness and performance of
audio drivers. It can be used to verify the quality of audio bringup and prevent
regression. The tool has found many audio [issues](#bugs-we-found) on different
devices.

[TOC]

## Prerequisites
Make sure these packages are on the host to compile the tool.
```Shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git pkg-config build-essential libasound2-dev
```

Make sure these packages are on the device under test(DUT) for testing.
```Shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install alsa-utils libasound2-dev
```
**NOTE:** ChromeOS has already had these packages.

## Build
The tool is a built-in binary in the ChromeOS test image. There are two ways to
build ALSA conformance test manually.

### Build in the ChromeOS chroot
```
(inside the cros chroot) emerge-${BOARD} audiotest
```
The binary will be in `/build/${BOARD}/usr/bin/alsa_conformance_test`.

The command `cros deploy ${DUT_IP} audiotest` can deploy this tool to a device.
The binary will be in /usr/bin/.

**NOTE:** The built-in binary is in `/usr/local/bin` where the developer root
is mounted at. The location is different from building by yourself. Make sure
that you use the correct binary before testing.

### Build in the git package
```
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/audiotest
cd audiotest
make alsa_conformance_test
```
The default binary is in `./alsa_conformance_test/alsa_conformance_test`.
You can set the variable OUT to change the build directory.
For example `make alsa_conformance_test OUT=/path/to/builddir` changes the
output to `/path/to/builddir/alsa_conformance_test/alsa_conformance_test`.

## Run
```
alsa_conformance_test [OPTIONS]
```
Notice that some devices may not work before the correct UCM (Use Case Manager)
is set. In ChromeOS, the UCM should be set automatically when selecting audio
nodes from UI. Users can also find the UCM file for each supported sound card
in `/usr/share/alsa/ucm/` and set it manually by [alsaucm](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-alsaucm/).

**Example:** To enable the headphone specified on `kbl_r5514_5663_max`.
```
alsaucm -c kbl_r5514_5663_max set _verb HiFi set _enadev "Headphone"
```

### Options
+ -h, --help
	+ Print this help and exit.
+ -P, --playback_dev <device>
	+ PCM device for playback. (default: NULL)
+ -C, --capture_dev <device>
	+ PCM device for capture. (default: NULL)
+ -c, --channels <channels>
	+ Set channels. (default: 2)
+ -f, --format <format>
	+ Set format. (default: S16_LE)
+ -r, --rate <rate>
	+ Set rate. (default: 48000)
+ -p, --period <period>
	+ Set period. If not set, the default value set in the driver will be used.
+ -d, --durations <duration>
	+ Set durations(second). (default: 1.0)
+ -B, --block_size <block_size>
	+ Set block size in frames of each read(for input devices) and
      write(for output devices). (default: 240)
    + For more details, please refer to the section about [Underrun and Overrun](#underrun-and-overrun).
+ --debug
	+ Enable debug mode. (Not support multi-streams in this version)
+ --strict
	+ Enable strict mode. It will set params to the fixed value.
    + ALSA conformance test sets the rate and the period size nearest to the
      target. The final value may not be the same as a user set in the params.
      With this flag, the test will fail if these values are unexpected.

+ --iterations
	+ Number of times to run the tests specified. (default: 1)
+ --device_file:
	+ Device file path. It will load devices from the file. File format:
		```
	  	[name] [type] [channels] [format] [rate] [period] [block_size] [durations] # comment
      [type] could be either `PLAYBACK` or `CAPTURE` # comment
      	eg: hw:0,0 PLAYBACK 2 S16_LE 48000 240 240 10 # Example
		```
+ --merge_threshold
	+ Set merge_threshold_t. (default: 0.0001)
	+ If the value is not zero, there will be a dryrun to set the
	  merge_threshold_sz as the median of frame diff. Points with
	  TIME_DIFF less than merge_threshold_t and SAMPLES_DIFF less
	  than merge_threshold_sz will be merged.

## Results
These are the functions that ALSA conformance test covers.

### Correctness of params
Sometimes audio device claims that it can support some params but it actually
does not. In this case, snd_pcm_hw_params fails. Therefore, verifying all
params can be set correctly is necessary.
```
---------PRINT PARAMS---------
PCM name: hw:0,0
card: acpd7219m98357 [acpd7219m98357]

```

### Correctness of card name
A specific UCM configuration file is sometimes required for a USB audio device.
If the card name is the default USB card name, like 'USB Audio Device'
it will not be possible to add a UCM configuration file because UCM files are matched by card name.
```

```

### Correctness of usb audio mixer control

If the device is a USB audio device, it is very important that the USB audio mixer control exposes reasonable values. Otherwise, applications may rely on incorrect values and lead to undefined behavior.

#### Mixer name
The following are the requirements for the USB audio mixer control name for playback:

* Headphone
* Headset
* Headset Earphone
* Speaker
* PCM
* Master
* Digital
* Speaker Volume

The following are the requirements for the USB audio mixer control name for capture:

* Capture
* Digital Capture
* Mic
* Microphone
* Headset
* Mic Volume

#### Number of mixers
Device can only have one playback/capture mixer control system can recognize. Otherwise system will fail to know which control should be select in the system.

#### Mixer volume control ability
If the mixer control does not have the ability to control volume, there is likely something wrong with it. The main function of a mixer control for a USB audio device is to control volume.

#### Mixer volume db range
The volume db range must be within a reasonable range. If the volume db range is not reasonable, the system may use it as a basis for its actions, which could cause incorrect behavior.

* The playback pass criteria are: 500 <= db_range_max - db_range_min <= 20000.

#### Mixer playback volume range
The system will use the playback volume range to calculate the percentage of volume that should be increased with one volume up/down event. If the value is less than 10, it will cause incorrect behavior. The minimum value for the volume range is 10.

#### Example
This headset is `Cyber Acoustics`, and the device info is

```

		Mixer volume_range: [0, 37]
```

* number of mixer is 1 - pass
* The mixer name "PCM" is a valid name. - pass
* This mixer has volume control, which is indicated by the has_volume value of 1. - pass
* The mixer's db_range is 9999999, which is outside the acceptable range of 500-20000. - fail
* Mixer volume_range is 37, is >= 10 - pass

### Stability of rate
The number of samples consumed / time must be the same as the sampling rate.
For short-term, it can be checked every time when writing a block into the
device by calculating samples_diff / time_diff.
```
TIME_DIFF(s)    HW_LEVEL       READ               RATE
0.000780757           32          0       40985.863719
0.000791478           72          0       50538.359879
0.000834111          112          0       47955.248162
0.000838265          152          0       47717.607201
```

For long-term, the tool can record all data when hw_level changes. And then,
it will use linear regression to find out the measured rate. If measured rate
is not close to the sampling rate, or standard error from linear regression is
too large, the device doesnâ€™t have enough stability of rate.

```
rate: 48001.729135
rate error: 7.050352
```

The [script](#script) only uses the long-term rate to determine pass or fail
because an unstable short-term rate may not affect the whole stability.


**Explaination of fields**

+ HW_LEVEL - Hardware level. The number of frames in a device buffer.
+ READ - The cumulative number of frames has been read since the beginning.

**Explaination of point merge**
```
TIME_DIFF(s)    HW_LEVEL              PLAYED           DIFF               RATE

0.001000082          280                1160             48        47996.064323
0.001016092          232                1208             48        47239.816867
0.000983772          424                1256             48        48791.793220
0.000998709          400                1280             24        24031.024052
0.000082259          376                1304             24        291761.387812 [Merged]
```

In the last two lines above, the device consumes 24 samples twice in a short time
instead of 48 samples in the fixed period and result in higher rate error.
To reduce the error, points with TIME_DIFF less than merge_threshold_t and SAMPLES_DIFF less than merge_threshold_sz will be merged. The merge_threshold_sz is determined automatically by the test and merge_threshold_t can be set by --merge_threshold option.
With the --merge_threshold set to 0.0001, the last two points will be merged, and only
the latter point is counted in linear regression. The result of point merge is the same as below:
```
TIME_DIFF(s)    HW_LEVEL              PLAYED           DIFF               RATE
0.001000772          376                1064             48        47962.972585
0.001000089          328                1112             48        47995.728380
0.001000082          280                1160             48        47996.064323
0.001016092          232                1208             48        47239.816867
0.000983772          424                1256             48        48791.793220
0.001080968          376                1304             48        44404.6447258
```


### Stability of step
If a device consumes too large a block at once, we cannot maintain the buffer
level at low. This affects continuous latency. To measure this, the tool can
monitor hw_ptr and see whether the largest step during monitoring is small
enough.

```
step min: 8
step max: 288
```

### Runtime of each ALSA API
The runtime of APIs is also important. If it needs a long time to open PCM
device, it might affect stream efficiency or cause long latency.
```

```

### Correctness of recorded samples
Without any help from users, we can verify the correctness of recorded samples
by checking whether all of them are zeros. The tool shows whether each channel
is a zero channel, which means all samples in this channel are zeros. Usually
the recorded samples should not be all zeros.
```
zero channels: 0 1 // Channel 0 is not a zero channel but channel 1 is.
```

### Underrun and Overrun
The basic request of the audio device is not causing any underrun or overrun.
+ Underrun happens when there are no frames to playback on a running device.
  It makes the device play obsolete samples in the buffer, which sounds like
  glitches.

+ Overrun happens when frames in a device buffer are more than buffer size.
  It makes the device have a long delay and the latest recorded samples will
  overlay the old ones.

The block size is the size ALSA conformance test puts data into or gets data
from a device buffer. For playback, it puts data into the device once the
remaining frames in the device buffer are smaller than the block size. For
capture, it gets data from a device once the remaining frames in the device
buffer are larger than the block size. Users can adjust the block size to
detect whether this size might cause underrun or overrun.

```
number of underrun: 0
number of overrun: 0
```

### Example
These are some examples to show how to use ALSA conformance test.

+ Get the PCM name
Before testing, to get the PCM name of the device is necessary. The name format
is `hw:{CARD},{DEVICE}`. Users can get it by the command `aplay -l` and
`arecord -l`.
```Shell
> aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: sofglkda7219max [sof-glkda7219max], device 0: Speakers (*) []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 0: sofglkda7219max [sof-glkda7219max], device 1: Headset (*) []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 0: sofglkda7219max [sof-glkda7219max], device 5: HDMI1 (*) []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 0: sofglkda7219max [sof-glkda7219max], device 6: HDMI2 (*) []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 0: sofglkda7219max [sof-glkda7219max], device 7: HDMI3 (*) []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```
From this result, the PCM name for internal speaker is `hw:0,0` and for
headset is `hw:0,1`. We will use `hw:0,0` as a playback and `hw:0,1` as capture
device for the below examples.

+ Show the range of parameters of PCM device
```
alsa_conformance_test -P hw:0,0 --dev_info_only
```
+ Run playback and get the result
```
alsa_conformance_test -P hw:0,0
```
+ Run capture and get the result
```
alsa_conformance_test -C hw:0,1
```
+ Try to change the rate and format
```
alsa_conformance_test -P hw:0,0 -r 44100 -f S32_LE
```
+ Try to show detail of playback
```
alsa_conformance_test -P hw:0,0 -d 0.1 --debug
```
+ Playback and capture at the same time
```
alsa_conformance_test -P hw:0,0 -C hw:0,1
```
+ Test playback for more times
```
alsa_conformance_test -P hw:0,0 --iterations 10
```
+ Playback and capture at the same time with different params
```Shell
> cat ./device

### Test Suites
+ test_card_name
    + Check whether card name is in the block list.
+ test_params
    + Check whether all parameters can be set correctly.
+ test_rates
    + Check whether all estimated rates are the same as what it set.
+ test_all_pairs
    + Check whether the audio is still stable when mixing different params.
      The test will check if rates meet our expectation when testing all
      combinations of channels, sample rates and formats.
+ test_usb_mixer
    + Check whether the usb device exposes the required alsa mixer controls.
    If the device is not a usb audio device, this test will be skiped.

### Results
The result will show pass or fail.
